 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.047   TIME= 21:01:11
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.

 Material number 4 (used by element 89503) should normally have at least 
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.                                          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      10.188   TIME= 21:01:13
 Too many nodes 5585 are included in the force-distributed-surface       
 constraint identified by real constant set 2.  This may greatly affect  
 solver performance due to large wave fronts and memory consumption.     
 Also check results carefully and consider solving with a different      
 unit system.
