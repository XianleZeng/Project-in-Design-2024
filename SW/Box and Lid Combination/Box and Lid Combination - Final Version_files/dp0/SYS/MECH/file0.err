 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.859   TIME= 20:51:05
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.672   TIME= 20:51:05
 Material number 4 (used by element 89561) should normally have at least 
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.                                          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       9.000   TIME= 20:51:07
 Too many nodes 5853 are included in the force-distributed-surface       
 constraint identified by real constant set 2.  This may greatly affect  
 solver performance due to large wave fronts and memory consumption.     
 Also check results carefully and consider solving with a different      
 unit system.
